For IS445: Data Viz
# Deploy a GitHub Page
Your assignment for this week is to build a web page on GitHub pages (which can be with a “burner account”, as long as you supply that info to us) that includes a vega-lite visualization of the building inventory dataset.

This will have three steps:

1. Develop a visualization using vega-lite using the building inventory data
2. Deploy this visualization in JSON format to your GitHub pages
3. Write the initialization javascript code to create the visualization in your page
You will have a week and a half to do this, as we have not covered quite enough yet to make this work.
# A Word for me
1. I used the inventory data set to visualize relationship between Year Constructd and Year Acquired. The visualization can be found here-https://vega.github.io/editor/#/url/vega-lite/N4IgJAzgxgFgpgWwIYgFwhgF0wBwqgegIDc4BzJAOjIEtMYBXAI0poHsDp5kTykBaADZ04JACyUAVhDYA7EABoQAEySYUqUAwBOgtBmx5CBBjQZR+NLmzaD+q9cRoAvanUYt2nHNpqyyAEwADACMAJxywrKiAO5wcADWQQEETKaCyn5kAPp+pLKYbNoAnpRQEMQgAL5KyNoJ+lA02lCCcIogcLJQbJn+aKAAHgMgAGY0cBn6AJpwSNoABADCchCY2uaYcModmMU47ehbCDhFSHo1IMUj45M76LPzCwCCUACOptrbu-uHIMenbTnDrQc6HUB7A76TA0BDtKoIqpAA

2. The visualization has been deployed here with .json format under the name - "visualization.vl.json".

3. The a_four.html here is my html page with the visualization and javascript initialization.
